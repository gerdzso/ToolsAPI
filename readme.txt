If you want to controll your own tool with woodys OS
you must make possible to controll via i2c bus.

After that you should implement the ToolsAPI interface,
build it and copy the jar file to the woodys tools folder.

You can find an example of a gripper (woody_tool_gripper).
It is an eclipse project. It contains the arduino code as well.
